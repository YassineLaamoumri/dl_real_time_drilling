# Volve Dataset: Depth vs. Time Logs Context

## Overview
The Equinor Volve field dataset (publicly released WITSML data from the North Sea) organizes raw drilling telemetry into two main folders: `depth/` and `time/`. This split follows standard oil & gas industry practices for handling measured depth (MD)-based vs. elapsed time (ELT)-based logging. 

- **Source**: Derived from WITSML (Wellsite Information Transfer Standard Markup Language) exports, converted to CSV.
- **Purpose**: Separates geological/subsurface snapshots (depth-tied) from operational/rig performance data (time-series).
- **Key Files**: Each well (e.g., 15/9-F-9 A) has corresponding CSVs like `Norway-NA-15_$47$_9-F-9 A depth.csv` and `Norway-NA-15_$47$_9-F-9 A time.csv`.
- **Challenges**: Mixed data types (strings, numerics, timestamps); potential encoding issues; need for alignment (time-to-depth interpolation).

## Depth Logs (`depth/` folder)
These CSVs log data sampled at specific **measured depths** along the wellbore (in meters or TVD - True Vertical Depth). They provide a static view of the subsurface as the drill advances.

## Time Logs (`time/` folder)
These CSVs capture **real-time** rig and drilling parameters over elapsed time, independent of depth. They're the "heartbeat" of operations. Based on the header from `Norway-NA-15_$47$_9-F-9 A time.csv`, columns overlap with depth logs (e.g., ROP, WOB, gamma) but emphasize time-indexing, with additions like smoothed metrics (30s/5s avgs), survey points (SRV_), real-time pressures (e.g., SPP5s), and volumes.

### Characteristics
- **Sampling**: High-frequency (e.g., 1-10 seconds intervals), continuous during active drilling.
- **Use Cases**: Real-time optimization, anomaly detection (e.g., vibrations via torque spikes), predictive maintenance (e.g., bit wear from ROP drop). Great for time-series ML like LSTM for stuck pipe prediction.
- **Size**: Larger files (millions of rows); dense, noisy (outliers from sensor glitches).
- **Example Viz**: Plot ROP vs. Time to spot efficiency drops during connections; correlate with mud weight changes.

## Why the Split?
- **Data Nature**: Depth logs are position-based (geology-focused, lower freq); time logs are event-based (ops-focused, high freq). Merging requires interpolation (e.g., using bit position to map time to depth).
- **Efficiency**: Separate processing pipelinesâ€”depth for static analysis, time for dynamic forecasting.
- **WITSML Origin**: Standard export groups logs by log type (mnemonic: `MNEM` for depth vs. real-time channels).
- **Common Pitfalls**: Timestamps may need timezone conversion (UTC to local); depth files lack time context, time files lack precise geology.

## Usage Tips for EDA/ML
- **Loading**: Use `fireducks.pandas` or `polars` for big CSVs (handles mixed types). Set `low_memory=False`, `on_bad_lines="skip"`. Preview with `df.head()` and `df.dtypes`.
- **Cleaning**: 
  - Parse timestamps: `pd.to_datetime(df['RIG TIME'], utc=True)`.
  - Handle mixed cols: Specify dtypes (e.g., `{'Lithology': str, 'ROP': float}`).
  - Resample time data: Downsample to 1-min for viz (e.g., `df.resample('1T', on='TIMESTAMP').mean()`).
- **Merging**: Join on nearest depth/time via `scipy.interpolate` or well trajectory logs.
- **EDA Steps**:
  1. Load one time CSV: Check for ROP, pressure trends.
  2. Load depth CSV: Inspect gamma/resistivity profiles.
  3. Stats: `df.describe()`, missingness `df.isnull().sum()`.
  4. Viz: Seaborn/Matplotlib for correlations (e.g., ROP vs. WOB).
- **ML Ideas**: 
  - Time: Predict ROP from params (Random Forest/XGBoost).
  - Depth: Classify lithology from logs (CNN on profiles).
  - Combined: Anomaly detection in real-time streams.

  - WITSML Spec: [Energistics.org](https://www.energistics.org/standards/witsml).
